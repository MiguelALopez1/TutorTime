### What is Tutor Time?
Tutor Time revolutionizes the educational connection experience by intuitively linking tutors and students based on user-specific profiles, much like the simplified interaction offered by platforms such as Tinder. The application harnesses advanced Android features, including ViewModel, LiveData, and RecyclerView, ensuring a smooth, efficient handling of data and superior user interface dynamics. The strategic implementation of Fragment management further refines the user journey, enhancing the modular structure of the app and fostering an environment conducive to scalable development and continuous user engagement.
### How Does it Work?
Tutor Time is designed to be a highly interactive and customizable platform for connecting students and tutors. Here's a breakdown of how it works, incorporating the additional features:
- **Profile Creation and Matching:** Both students and tutors set up detailed profiles. These profiles help the app's algorithm to intuitively match tutors and students based on their specific educational needs, expertise, and preferences.
- **Personalized Rating System:** Users rate each other as individuals. This means a student rates a tutor, or vice versa, based on their overall interaction and effectiveness, offering a comprehensive view of each user's reliability and teaching or learning quality. Keep in mind if you do not wish to see your own rating you can turn that off!
- **RecyclerView for Conversation Management:** The app utilizes Android's RecyclerView feature to display a list of all current conversations. This tool makes it easy for users to track and manage ongoing discussions, whether they are coordinating upcoming sessions, discussing academic topics, or simply engaging in post-session feedback.
- **Autonomy in Learning and Teaching Methods:** Tutor Time allows for a hands-off approach, where both students and tutors have the freedom to set up their learning or teaching methods as they prefer. This autonomy ensures that each party can engage in a manner that is most effective and comfortable for them, leading to a more personalized and fruitful educational experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Leveraging advanced Android features like ViewModel, LiveData, and RecyclerView, Tutor Time provides a smooth and efficient user interface. This ensures easy navigation and a seamless user experience, making the process of finding and interacting with tutors or students straightforward and stress-free.
- **Flexible and Scalable Design:** The strategic implementation of Fragment management in the app's design enhances its modular structure. This not only makes the app scalable and adaptable to evolving user needs but also ensures continuous engagement through an environment conducive to learning and teaching.

In summary, Tutor Time works by creating an environment where students and tutors can effortlessly find their ideal educational matches. It combines intuitive profile matching with a comprehensive rating system and efficient conversation management, all within a flexible and user-friendly platform. This approach empowers users to tailor their educational experience to their specific needs and preferences, making Tutor Time a revolutionary tool in the realm of educational connections.
### Where are we now in Development?
Tutor Time is yet to be aviable to the public, currently we just finished making all the fragments and navigation between them. Now we are focusing on the bulk of the backend. We expect a beta version to be aviable soon. Here are some images of what we have done so far!
